## Short Description
Study Buddy solves information overload by transforming PDFs into AI-generated summaries, flashcards, Q&A, slides, and study plans, with an AI tutor chatbot for personalized learning.

## Long Description
Study Buddy is an innovative AI agentic solution designed to tackle the pervasive problem of information overload and the lack of personalized study materials for students. It empowers users to upload PDF documents, which are then intelligently processed using a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. This transforms raw content into a comprehensive suite of personalized learning aids, including AI-generated summaries, interactive flashcards, automated question-and-answer sets for effective revision, professional study slides, and structured study plans with multiple milestones. A key differentiator is its integrated AI chatbot, which functions as a dedicated tutor, providing context-aware answers exclusively from the uploaded documents, ensuring highly relevant and accurate guidance. This solution significantly streamlines the study process, enhances comprehension, and provides a truly agentic AI-powered learning experience.
